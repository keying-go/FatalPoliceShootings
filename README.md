"state_via.py" is a plotly dash app that has a slider for year and a dropdown for race. 


"white_count.html","black_count.html","white_rate.html","black_rate.html" are visualizations developed by plotly to show White American and Black American killings count and rate each year and each state.

Black Americans are killed at a much higher rate than White Americans. Although half of the people shot and killed by police are White, Black Americans are shot at a disproportionate rate. They account for roughly 14 percent of the U.S. population and are killed by police at more than twice the rate of White Americans. Hispanic Americans are also killed by police at a disproportionate rate.
